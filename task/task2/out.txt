TORONTO -- When the Toronto Raptors made a franchise-changing trade this summer -- sending DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a first-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green -- the rationale could be summed up in one sentence: The potential upside was worth the risk.
As the Raptors ready to host the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors on Thursday night in a nationally televised game that many are viewing as a potential NBA Finals preview, it looks like the gamble by Raptors president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri has paid off.
"It's a great trade for Toronto, even if [Leonard] leaves," one league executive said. "I just never saw them going any further than they had with DeMar."
ESPN surveyed several NBA executives to gauge their thoughts on Leonard through six weeks, and how he has looked after spending virtually all of last season on the sidelines due to a quad injury. And while there was some debate over whether he is all the way back to what he was before the injury, there was no disputing the fact that Leonard is, at a minimum, back to playing like one of the league's elite players once again.
"He's pretty much back to his old self," Green said. "Just physicality-wise of being able to sustain back-to-backs is the only thing. ... He's fresh, he's playing at a high level, the level he normally plays at."
